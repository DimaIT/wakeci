#  - artifacts are collected only for builds with status `finished` or `failed`

# Automatically run the job every configured interval (cron expression)

# Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".

# List of tasks executed on build's status change
# Available handlers:
#  - `on_pending` - when the status of the build changes to `pending`
#  - `on_running` - when the status of the build changes to `running`
#  - `on_aborted` - when the status of the build changes to `aborted` or `timed out`
#  - `on_failed` - when the status of the build changes to `failed`
#  - `on_finished` - when the status of the build changes to `finished`
# Note: If one of the commands failed, it doesn't fail the whole build

# Default environmetal variables, inject by wake:
# "WAKE_BUILD_ID" - current build id, e.g. 169
# "WAKE_BUILD_WORKSPACE" - path to the build's workspace, e.g. ~/workspace/169/
# "WAKE_JOB_NAME" - name of the job, e.g. ask_a_cow
# "WAKE_JOB_PARAMS" - URL encoded `params` of the job. Useful to start another
#                     job with the same params, e.g. "sleep=5&print=true"
# "WAKE_CONFIG_DIR" - path to the directory with all job configuration files,
#                     e.g. ~/jobs/
# "WAKE_URL" - URL of the service, e.g. https://myci.space/

# To modify or introduce new environmental variables during the build execution,
# create `build.env` file in WAKE_BUILD_WORKSPACE directory.
#
# Example:
# echo "{environment_variable_name}={value}" >> build.env
#
# There are multiple ways of defining environment for running tasks. If the same
# environmental variable is defined multiple times, the priority is:
#  - default OS env variables
#  - wake env variables `WAKE_*`
#  - variables from `params` section
#  - variables from `env` section
#  - variables from `build.env` file
